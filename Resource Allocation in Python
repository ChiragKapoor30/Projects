# Resource Allocation Project Report

## Introduction

In this project, we are addressing a resource allocation problem where we need to assign resources to different locations for various tasks. The objective is to minimize the overall resource cost while satisfying location-specific and task-specific constraints.

## Problem Description

We have the following dataframes:

### Location Data

| Location   | Max Resource |
|------------|--------------|
| location1  | 500          |
| location2  | 600          |
| location3  | 250          |

### Work Data

| Work   | Min Resource |
|--------|--------------|
| work1  | 550          |
| work2  | 300          |

### Resource Cost Matrix

| Resource Cost   | Work 1 | Work 2 |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| location1       | 150    | 200    |
| location2       | 220    | 310    |
| location3       | 210    | 440    |

## Model Creation and Constraints

We create a linear programming model using the PuLP library. The model aims to minimize the total resource cost while satisfying the following constraints:

1. Each location's allocated resources should not exceed its maximum resource capacity.
2. Each work's allocated resources should meet its minimum resource requirement.

## Model Solution

Let's solve the model and display the results:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pulp as plp
import numpy as np

# ... (Code for loading data and creating the model)

model.solve()
status = plp.LpStatus[model.status]

print("Optimal overall resource cost: ", str(plp.value(model.objective)))

for each in model.variables():
    print("Optimal cost of", each, ": " + str(each.value()))

The optimal solution will show the allocated resources for each location and work, along with the minimized overall resource cost.
Solution: 
Optimal overall resouce cost:  164500.0
Optimal cost of  R_11 : 200.0
Optimal cost of  R_12 : 300.0
Optimal cost of  R_21 : 100.0
Optimal cost of  R_22 : 0.0
Optimal cost of  R_31 : 250.0
Optimal cost of  R_32 : 0.0
